                    Many would rank Pua's numerous beautiful bays among the most
                    beautiful in Istria, and so you can find a number of
                    incredibly spectacular bathing spots with breathtaking sea
                    colors in the region. Magnificent pebble bays, hidden
                    idyllic natural beaches, well-kept stone beaches, small
                    sandy beaches and also quiet nudist bays, there is
                    definitely something for everyone. The nearest one is
                    Valkane beach which is 3km away, easily accessible by car or
                    bus. Some of the other spots we would recommend checking out
                    are Verudela, Stoja, Lungomare and Rt Kamenjak.

                    To add an extra layer of excitement to your vacation,
                    consider a boat trip to the Brijuni National Park, which
                    comprises fourteen small islands. If you prefer exploring
                    the island at your own pace, you can rent a golf cart or a
                    bicycle. There are numerous points of interest to explore,
                    such as the Roman villa ruins in Verige Bay. Additionally,
                    there are several other stop-off points, including small
                    churches, a dinosaur fossil site, a museum, and even a golf
                    course.
                    <br/><br/> On the northern edge of Veliki Brijun, a unique
                    Safari Park sprawls across 9 hectares, inhabited by a
                    fascinating mix of autochthonous Istrian and exotic South
                    American, African, and Asian fauna. Inhabitants of the
                    Safari Park include the Indian elephant Lanka, llamas (the
                    South American camels, which, according to native legend,
                    were domesticated in the very beginnings of human
                    existence), zebras, Indian sacred cows, and ostriches,
                    creating a friendly and unique atmosphere.
